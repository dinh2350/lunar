## How Each Lesson Works

Every day-XX.md file follows this format:

```
🎯 DAY GOAL      → One sentence: what you'll achieve today

📚 CONCEPTS       → New knowledge, explained with:
                     WHAT → Simple definition
                     WHY  → Why does this exist?
                     WHEN → When do you use it?
                     HOW  → How does it work? (with diagrams)
                     🔗 NODE.JS ANALOGY → Connect to what you know

🔨 HANDS-ON       → Step-by-step code to write

✅ CHECKLIST       → Verify everything works

💡 KEY TAKEAWAY   → One idea to remember

❓ SELF-CHECK      → Questions to test understanding
```

## Rules

1. **Read one day at a time.** Don't skip ahead.
2. **Type the code yourself.** Don't copy-paste.
3. **Answer the self-check questions.** If you can't, re-read.
4. **Use weekends to catch up**, not rush forward.
5. **If stuck > 30 minutes**, ask AI for help (you have Ollama!).
