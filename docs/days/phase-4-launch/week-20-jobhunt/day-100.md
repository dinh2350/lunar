## 🔑 Top 10 Lessons Learned

```
1. LLMs are tools, not magic
   → They're powerful but need structure (agents, tools, memory)

2. Prompt engineering is underrated
   → A good system prompt beats a bigger model

3. RAG makes LLMs 10x more useful
   → Give them access to your actual data, not just training data

4. Local models are surprisingly good
   → Llama 3 on Ollama handles 90% of use cases for free

5. The agent loop is the core pattern
   → Think → Act → Observe → Repeat — everything builds on this

6. SQLite is enough
   → FTS5 + sqlite-vec = full search engine, zero ops cost

7. Ship early, iterate fast
   → Your first version will be wrong — that's fine

8. Testing AI is different
   → You need eval sets and LLM-as-judge, not just unit tests

9. Security is not optional
   → Users WILL try to break your system

10. Build in public
    → Blog posts + GitHub + demo video > resume bullet points

## 💬 Final Words

You started this journey asking: *"Can a Node.js developer become an AI Engineer?"*

The answer is sitting in your GitHub repository. You didn't just learn about AI — you **built** an AI system from scratch. You understand how LLMs work, how agents think, how memory persists, how tools execute, how models are fine-tuned, and how to ship all of it to production.

That's not a tutorial completion certificate. That's **proof of work**.

Now go get that AI Engineer role. You've earned it. 🌙
