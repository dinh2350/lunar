### 1. LinkedIn Headline + About

```
Headline (120 chars):
"AI Engineer | Building Intelligent Agents with LLMs, TypeScript & Ollama | Open Source"

About section:
---
I'm an AI Engineer who builds intelligent systems with large language models.

Previously a Node.js developer, I transitioned to AI engineering by building 
Lunar — a self-hosted AI agent platform with long-term memory, tool use, 
and multi-channel support.

What I work with:
• LLMs: Ollama, Gemini, prompt engineering, fine-tuning
• AI Agents: Tool use, RAG, multi-agent coordination  
• Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Fastify, SQLite
• Infrastructure: Docker, CI/CD, monitoring

I'm passionate about making AI accessible and privacy-first. All my work 
runs locally — no expensive cloud APIs required.
