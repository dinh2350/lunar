## Cover Letter Template

Dear [Hiring Manager / Team],

I'm writing to express my interest in the [Role] position at [Company]. As an AI Engineer with hands-on experience building production AI agent systems, I'm excited about [specific company product/mission].

**What I bring:**

I recently completed Lunar — a self-hosted AI agent platform built over 100 days with TypeScript and Node.js. The project includes:
- An agentic reasoning loop with function calling and 12+ tools
- A hybrid memory system (BM25 + vector search) with 93% retrieval accuracy
- Multi-channel deployment (Telegram, Discord, Web) from a single agent core
- An eval framework for automated quality testing

This experience maps directly to [specific job requirement from posting].

**Why [Company]:**

[1-2 sentences about why this company specifically — reference their product, blog post, or technical challenge.]

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building AI systems from the ground up can contribute to [Company]'s goals.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Standing Out Tips

1. **Customize every application.** Reference the company's specific AI work.
2. **Lead with the project.** Lunar is more impressive than generic job experience for AI roles.
3. **Include metrics.** "93% accuracy", "100 days", "12 tools" — concrete numbers stick.
4. **GitHub link in every application.** Make it easy to see your code.
5. **Follow up at 1 week.** Polite LinkedIn message to hiring manager or recruiter.
6. **Contribute to their open source.** A PR to their repo is the ultimate cover letter.
