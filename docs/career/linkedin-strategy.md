### Headline
**AI Engineer | Building Self-Hosted AI Agents with TypeScript & Node.js | Open Source**

### About
I'm a software engineer who transitioned from full-stack Node.js development into AI engineering by building Lunar — a self-hosted AI agent platform with memory, tool use, and multi-channel support.

Over 100 days, I designed and shipped:
→ An agentic AI system with function calling and multi-step reasoning
→ A hybrid memory engine (BM25 + vector search) for long-term recall
→ A guard pipeline for prompt injection detection and safety
→ Multi-channel deployment (Telegram, Discord, Web) from a single agent core
→ Eval-driven development workflow for measurable AI quality

Tech: TypeScript, Node.js, Ollama, SQLite, Fastify, Next.js, Docker, LangChain patterns

I'm looking for AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Senior Backend roles where I can build intelligent systems at scale.

### Experience Entry

**AI Engineer — Lunar (Personal Project)**
*[Month Year] – Present*

Built a production-grade self-hosted AI agent platform from scratch in 100 days:
• Designed agent loop architecture with function calling, guard pipeline, and multi-provider LLM fallback
• Implemented hybrid memory system (SQLite FTS5 + sqlite-vec) achieving 93% retrieval accuracy at <50ms
• Built eval framework with 8 automated scenarios for regression detection
• Deployed via Docker Compose with Caddy (auto-HTTPS), Ollama, and Next.js control panel
• Created 12 tools, 4 channel integrations, and real-time streaming responses

Tech: TypeScript, Node.js, Fastify, SQLite, Ollama, Next.js, Docker, Vitest

- AI Engineering
- Large Language Models (LLM)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Prompt Engineering
- Vector Search / Embeddings
- TypeScript / Node.js
- Agent Architectures
- Eval & Testing for AI

## Networking Strategy

### Target Communities

| Platform | Community | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| LinkedIn | AI Engineer groups | Share blog posts, comment on others' work |
| Twitter/X | #BuildInPublic, AI dev accounts | Tweet progress, share insights |
| Discord | Ollama, LangChain, AI Tinkerers | Help others, share project |
| Reddit | r/LocalLLaMA, r/MachineLearning | Post project showcase |
| Dev.to | AI/ML tag | Publish technical articles |
| Hacker News | Show HN | Submit project when polished |

### Weekly Networking Routine

**Monday:** Share one technical insight on LinkedIn (memory, agents, tools — short post)
**Wednesday:** Engage with 5 AI-related posts (thoughtful comments, not just "great post!")
**Friday:** Share a code snippet or architecture decision on Twitter

### Connection Request Template

> Hi [Name], I came across your work on [specific topic]. I recently built an open-source AI agent platform (Lunar) and was particularly interested in your approach to [specific detail]. Would love to connect and exchange ideas on AI engineering.

### Responding to "Tell me about yourself"

> I'm a software engineer who builds AI systems with TypeScript and Node.js. Most recently, I completed a 100-day project called Lunar — a self-hosted AI agent with memory, tools, and multi-channel support. I designed the architecture from scratch, including a hybrid search memory system and an eval-driven development workflow. I'm now looking for opportunities where I can apply these skills to production AI products.
