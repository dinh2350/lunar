## Projects

### Lunar — Self-Hosted AI Agent Platform
**Solo Developer** | [github.com/yourusername/lunar](https://github.com/yourusername/lunar)

Built a production-grade AI agent platform from scratch over 100 days:

- **Agentic Architecture:** Designed multi-step reasoning loop with function calling, supporting 12+ tools and 3 LLM providers (Ollama, Gemini, Groq)
- **Hybrid Memory System:** Implemented BM25 (SQLite FTS5) + vector similarity (sqlite-vec) with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, achieving **93% retrieval accuracy at <50ms latency**
- **Safety Pipeline:** Built injection detection (regex + classifier), PII filtering, and output validation guards
- **Multi-Channel:** Unified agent serving Telegram, Discord, Web (Next.js + SSE streaming), and CLI from a single codebase
- **Eval Framework:** Created 8 automated eval scenarios with quality scoring, enabling confident prompt iteration
- **Production Deployment:** Dockerized stack with Caddy (auto-HTTPS), backup/recovery, monitoring, and CI/CD

**Tech:** TypeScript, Node.js, Fastify, SQLite, Ollama, Next.js, Docker, Vitest

## Resume Tips

1. **One page.** Recruiters spend 6 seconds scanning. Keep it tight.
2. **Quantify everything.** "93% accuracy", "12 tools", "<50ms", "$0/month".
3. **Lead with Lunar.** It's your strongest differentiator as an AI Engineer.
4. **Tailor per application.** Emphasize RAG for RAG-heavy roles, agents for agent roles.
5. **PDF format.** Name it `FirstName_LastName_AI_Engineer.pdf`.
6. **ATS-friendly.** Simple formatting, no tables in final version, standard section headers.
